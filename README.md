## Introduction
**StressLess** is an iOS application designed to help users manage their stress levels during intense study or work sessions. By providing break reminders based on a stress detection model that relies on the user's heart rate and HRV, the app sends notifications to prompt breaks as needed. It also showcases the user's stress trends over time. 

Note: The app is currently a proof of concept, and does not rely on real HealthKit data due to insufficient permissions, but does have simulated data to demonstrate the key features. 

## App Demo & Presentation 
A demo of the app running in the simulator with some of the main features highlighted can be found [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGnfpuVDyY/NJqm97sQsQqwYgypWb5CVg/watch?utm_content=DAGnfpuVDyY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h69146636bd)
